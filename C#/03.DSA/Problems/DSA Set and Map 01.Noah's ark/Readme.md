# **Noah's Ark**
### Help out the Modern-day Noah in his quest to save the animal species from the extinction. The only difference between Old-day Noah, and Modern-day Noah is that Modern-day Noah wants more than two of each species on the ark, but still wants them to be a even count.
### Write a program that keeps count of how many animals of each kind are on the ark and whether they are an even or not.
### Oh by the way he wants the list sorted in alphabetical order. Jeez... picky much?

## **Input**
