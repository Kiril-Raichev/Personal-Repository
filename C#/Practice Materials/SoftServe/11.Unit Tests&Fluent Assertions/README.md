# task
Create unit tests for a class Triangle that implements the next tasks:

1. Calculate the area of a triangle
2. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle
3. Return True or False depending on the triangle is right-angled or not
4. Return True or False depending on the triangle is equilateral or not
5. Return True or False depending on the triangle is isosceles or not
6. Return True or False depending on two triangles are congruent or not

Each method (or just constructor) should throw an InvalidArgumentException in case if the triangle is invalid
Equality of values of double type is considered as their difference in less than 0.001 percent of first of them.
